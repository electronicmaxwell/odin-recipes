    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is nothing short of a culinary masterpiece, a dish that embodies comfort, warmth, and the pure joy of eating. Imagine the moment you cut into a freshly baked lasagna: the layers of tender pasta, perfectly cooked, give way to a symphony of flavors. The rich, meaty sauce, simmered with aromatic garlic, onions, and herbs, melds beautifully with the tangy sweetness of tomatoes, creating a depth of flavor that’s both hearty and satisfying. And then there's the cheese—oh, the cheese! Creamy ricotta, stretchy mozzarella, and sharp Parmesan combine in a luscious, gooey layer that melts into every bite, making each mouthful a celebration of indulgence.</p>
    <p>What makes lasagna truly special is how all these elements come together in perfect harmony. Each layer contributes something unique: the pasta provides a tender structure, the sauce infuses every bite with robust flavor, and the cheese ties it all together with its rich, comforting texture. Baked to a golden perfection, with crispy edges and bubbling cheese, lasagna is the ultimate comfort food, offering a warm embrace on a plate. Whether shared with family around a dinner table or enjoyed as leftovers that seem to taste even better the next day, lasagna is more than just a meal—it's an experience, a reminder of the simple yet profound pleasure of good food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook 1 pound of sweet Italian sausage and ¾ pound of lean ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup minced onion and 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the meat mixture, and sauté until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1 (28 ounce) can of crushed tomatoes, 2 (6.5 ounce) cans of canned tomato sauce, 2 (6 ounce) cans of tomato paste, and ½ cup water. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Season the sauce with 2 tablespoons of white sugar, 4 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley (divided), 1 ½ teaspoons of dried basil leaves, 1 ½ teaspoons of salt (divided, or to taste), 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of fennel seeds, and ¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 12 lasagna noodles in the boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine 16 ounces of ricotta cheese with 1 egg, the remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley, and ½ teaspoon of salt. Mix until well blended.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread 1 ½ cups of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place 6 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, then top with a third of the mozzarella cheese slices (about ¼ pound).</li>
        <li>Spoon 1 ½ cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella, and sprinkle with ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, starting with the noodles, then ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and meat sauce, and ending with a final layer of mozzarella and Parmesan on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil, ensuring the foil does not touch the cheese to prevent sticking. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 15 minutes before serving, allowing the layers to set and making it easier to cut and serve.</li>
    </ol>
